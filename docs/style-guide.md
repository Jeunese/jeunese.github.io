# Style guide

Following a set of writing guidelines helps ensure consistency, content quality, and a good user experience of product documentation and UI content. The guidelines presented in this article are based on substantial research, content design principles, UX writing expertise, and industry standards.

This isn't a complete list of every language, grammar, or formatting rule or convention. The style guide is designed to deal with common scenarios and to recommend best practices for technical documentation and in-product content.

You can apply the following [Lean writing principles](/style-guide?id=lean-writing-principles), [Word choice guidelines](/style-guide?id=word-choice-guidelines), and [Writing conventions](/style-guide?id=writing-conventions) to both technical writing and UX writing.

For guidelines that are specific to technical writing, see [Technical Writing Guidelines](/technical-writing). For guidelines that are specific to UX writing, see [UX Writing Guidelines](/ux-writing).

## Tone of voice

This guide refers to *tone of voice* rather than [voice and tone](/voice-and-tone?id=voice-and-tone-or-tone-of-voice) as separate constructs. 

Tone of voice defines how you talk to your audience. This is based on the type of company, target audience, and purpose of the content. For a software company, the purpose of product **documentation** is to provide users with quick product reference material for what the product does, how it works, and how to set it up. The purpose of **in-product copy** is to help end users of the UI complete tasks easily and effectively with that company's software, in real time.

These are the high-level communication goals that inform the individual writing elements in this style guide.

- [Be clear](/voice-and-tone?id=be-clear) (direct, simple, precise, and concise)
- [Be human](/voice-and-tone?id=be-human) (conversational, personal, positive, and inclusive)
- [Be useful](/voice-and-tone?id=be-useful) (objective, user-centric, action-oriented, and goal-focused)

To achieve these characteristics, your writing style needs to follow some more granular principles and guidelines.

## Lean writing principles

Write clearly, precisely, and concisely to make content easier to read and understand.


### Keep content short and simple

Shorter paragraphs, sentences, and words are easier to scan, easier to understand, and more accessible to people who struggle with reading. Even advanced readers benefit from short and simple language because it results in faster processing and better comprehension. With this in mind, aim to:

- Write short sentences, and keep to a limit:
    - For online documentation, write sentences that are no more than 30 words.
    - For UI content, write sentences that are no more than 15 words.
- Separate different points or thoughts into different sentences.
- Use common contractions, such as "don't" instead of "do not".
- Use everyday words, such as "help" instead of "assistance".
- Remove excess words that don't add meaning to the sentence, for example: "Remove each ~~individual~~ item from the list." 
- Replace wordy phrases with single words where possible, for example: "due to the fact that" can be replaced with "because".
- Use as few words as possible to portray meaning, for example: "You'll be asked to change your password ~~at some point~~ before you next sign in."

Keep in mind that localisation can lengthen text by 20 to 30 percent.

Follow the appropriate writing conventions to help keep sentences shorter:

|Tip | Example |
|---|---|
|Use the active voice, which is more direct and easier to understand than the passive voice. |"You can send emails from your phone", rather than "Emails *can be sent from* your phone".|
|Write sentences in the imperative mood, which removes unnecessary words. | "If you need further help, ~~you can~~ contact the Support team". |
|Use [present tense](https://jeunese.github.io/#/style-guide?id=present-tense) where possible, which makes sentences shorter and more straightforward.|"This opens a form", rather than "This will open a form".|
|Refer to the user in second person, which more direct and makes it easier to write in the active voice. |"You can save documents" instead of "The user can save documents"|
|Use common contractions, which shortens sentences and helps to avoid users missing the word "not".|"We don't recommend deleting items", rather than "We do not recommend deleting items".|

### Write purposeful content

Write every sentence and choose every word with purpose, direction, and meaning.

- Write only to say something relevant that the reader or user can use.
- Use adjectives with purpose, not as filler.
- Don't write to take up space.
- Don't provide unnecessary context or detail.
- Don't tell the reader how to think or feel, such as "Setting this up is easy"; allow the reader to think or feel based on what you write.

### Get to the point, quicker

Follow these tips to get to the point in your communication with readers.

|Tip | Example |
|---|---|
|Avoid buried verbs (nominalisation): using a noun and a verb when a verb alone would portray the meaning.  | "Follow the guidelines for testing your software", rather than "Follow the guidelines for *performing a test of* your software". Turning the word "test" into an action removed the need for the word "performing".|
|Omit prepositional phrases. | "Select the plus sign ~~in order~~ to add a new user" or "~~In this case~~, delete the file." |
|Use adverbs in place of prepositional phrases.  | "This allows you to use the app effectively", rather than "This allows you to use the app *with great effectiveness*". |
|Replace prepositional phrases with the possessive.| "Find the computer's instructions", rather than "Find *the instructions for the computer*".|
|Avoid grammatical expletives (words that add emphasis by delaying the subject), such as "it is" or "there are". |"There are six items in the list", could be reworded to "The list has six items".|

## Word choice guidelines

Use clear, consistent, objective, and human language.

### Use plain English

-  Avoid marketing language and technical jargon.
-  Use industry-standard terminology when it will improve user understanding.
-  Use technical language only when it's needed, and try to also explain it generally.
-  Spend time researching what words the intended readers use rather than defaulting to corporate language.
-  Use intended words instead of Latin abbreviations, such as "specifically" instead of "i.e.".
-  Don't use non-English words and phrases.
-  Avoid abbreviations except where the abbreviation is better known than the full term or phrase, for example, URL.

|Avoid | Use instead |Exceptions
|---|---|---|
|access	|see; edit; find; use; view||
|allow (see also **enable**) | let||
|AKA|or; formerly||

|provides|gives||
|utilize|use||
|via| through|
|vice versa| NA – write out the reverse in full, for example, "There might be detractors and no promotors, or there might be promotors and no detractors."

### Use unambiguous terms

-  Use terms that are clear and understood by global audiences without need of special or local cultural knowledge.
-  Avoid "would", "should", and "may", which can be ambiguous in describing whether something *will*, *must*, or *can* be done.
-  Don't use double-negatives, for example, use "like" instead of "not unlike".

|Avoid | Use instead |Exceptions

| surface | expose; uncover; reveal; make available ||
| since (see also **as**) | because ||
|wish|	want; need ||	
|would	|can	||

### Use user-focused language

Be user-centred rather than system-centred.

- Refer to user actions instead of system actions, for example, "select" instead of "click". In this example, “select” is what a human does; “click” is what a mouse does.
- Address the user directly; use the second person "you" instead of "the customer", "the user", or "the administrator", for example, “Save your changes”.
- Focus on what the user can do instead of what the system is doing for the user, for example, say "You can share documents with others" instead of "We allow you to share your documents with others".
- Avoid talking about UI elements, like buttons and menus. Instead, describe the user action, such as "Choose your application" instead of "Open the dropdown menu to choose from a list of applications".
- Use active voice to encourage conversational sentences, for example, "You can change your profile image" instead of "Your profile image can be changed".
- Try starting sentences with a verb, for example, "Change your profile image in the **Settings** page."

|Avoid | Use instead | Exceptions|
|---|---|---|
|button (see also **checkbox**)|Describe the user action, for example, "Save your document".|
|checkbox (see also **button**)|Describe the user action, for example, "Select **Remember me**".
|click| select; choose|
|menu|Describe the user action, for example, "Go to **Settings > Profile**. | Include the word "menu" if it's needed for clarity.| 
|press (see also **type**)| enter|
|return|submit|
|tab|Describe the user action, for example, "Select **Insights**". | Include the word "tab" if it's needed for clarity.
|tab through| navigate through|
|type (see also **press**)| enter|
|toggle on/off | switch on; switch off; turn on using the toggle; turn off using the toggle|

### Use unbiased, human-centric, and inclusive language

You're talking to humans, so be sensitive to the human meaning of words.

- Avoid offensive or violent terms, like "abort", "hit", "force", "reject", "kill", "hang", and "terminate".
- Avoid terms that reflect historical racial , such as using colour to communicate something is "good" or "bad", and references that carry forward the master/slave paradigm.
- Use gender-neutral alternatives to "he", "she", "him", and "her".

|Avoid | Use instead  |
|---|---|
|abort| end; leave; stop; exit; cancel |
|agnostic | platform-independent|
|blacklist (see also **whitelist**)| blocklist; exclude list; deny list|
|black box testing (see also **white box testing**)| functional testing; acceptance testing|
|black hat hacker (see also **white hat hacker**)|bad actor; unauthorized user; malicious hacker|
|blind|	anonymous; ignore|
|disable|turn off|
|dummy data/value|placeholder data/value; sample data/value|
|execute| run|
|exploit| use|
|grandfather|legacy; pre-existing|
|hand (as in “right-hand side of the screen”)|NA – remove word, for example, “On the right ~~hand~~ side”|
|hands-off|automatic|
|hands-on|	direct|
|hang| freeze; stop responding; not responding|
|hit|select|
|kill|end; stop|
|man hours|person hours; time; resources; effort|
|man-in-the-middle|	attacker-in-the-middle; on-path attacker; or name the specific attack type |
|master	|main; primary; lead(er)|
|mute	|silence|
|native|	built-in|
|owner	|lead, manager, expert|
|sanity check	|smoke test; confidence check; coherence check|
|slave	|secondary; subordinate; follower|
|terminate|stop; exit; cancel; end|
|trigger|prompt; start ; generate|
|white glove|	high-touch; premium|
|whitelist (see also **blacklist**)| allowlist; include list|
|white box testing (see also **black box testing**)	|glass box testing; clear box testing|
|white hat hacker (see also **black hat hacker**)| Use a specific job title, such as, “Cyber Defense Analyst”.

### Avoid subjective terms

Avoid resumé statements and claims that are subject to interpretation and could set users up for disappointment. Focus only on what the reader needs to know and let the reader decide for themselves how good (or bad) something is.

- Don't use value judgements that are subject to indvidual differences in perception, like, "great" or "amazing".
- Don't use marketing or sales terminology, like "easily" or "state of the art".

|Avoid | Use instead| Exceptions|
|---|---|---|
|amazing|NA – remove word||
|easily; easy| NA – remove word; if necessary, use “straightforward” instead.||
|just (see also **only**)|NA – remove word||
|latest	|if necessary, use “up to date”.||
|obviously|NA – remove word||
|only (see also **just**)|NA – remove word, for example, "The process ~~only~~ takes 5 minutes."| When something is limited, for example, "You can only have one user name".
| quick; quickly | NA – remove word; if necessary, refer to the number of steps or the specific amount of time instead.|
|simple; simply	| NA – remove word||

### Be considerate, not over-polite

Avoid overusing "please", "thank you", and "sorry", especially for normal operations of the program. Adding these terms might seem polite, but they can come across as disingenuous and slow people down by adding wordiness to your sentences.

|Term | Guidance | When to use (example) | When to remove (example) |
|---|---|---|---|
|Please | Use "please" only in situations when asking for permission or forgiveness, such as when you're asking a user to do something that's inconvenient or when the software is at fault. | "Please try again later." | "To view the file, ~~please~~ select **View**."|
|Thank you | Use "thank you" when you're asking someone to provide input that's inconvenient. Convey gratitude from the people behind the documentation or product rather than the system itself. |"Thank you for giving us your feedback!" |"Check that you've entered your email address correctly before submitting. ~~Thank you~~."  |
|Sorry | Use "sorry" only in situations that cause problems for the user, such as a system crash or data loss. Don't apologise for how the product or service is designed to function. | "Sorry. We were unable to connect you to the service. Please try again later." |"~~Sorry.~~ It looks like your card is expired." |

Software and product documentation should, above all else, be *considerate* more so than polite, which means putting the needs of the reader or user first. 

For example, an error message that says *"Sorry! There was a generic error"* is polite, but not especially useful because it focuses on its own function, and not what the reader or user needs to do. 

### Use terminology consistently

Without consistency, documentation can come across as unreliable or lacking credibility.

-  Don't switch between terms in the product documentation or in the product itself.
-  After introducing an acronym, don't switch back and forth between full words and the acronym.
-  Don't switch between language conventions, such as American and British spellings.
-  In instructions, refer to UI elements exactly as they appear in the product.

## Writing conventions

This section provides guidance on some of the mechanics of technical writing, like punctuation, capitalisation, and lists. These are the individual elements that help make content clear and understandable.

### Punctuation

Punctuation provides meaning in the absence of the rhythm, intonation, and pauses that speech would otherwise offer for clarity.

-  Keep punctuation simple. Complex constructions, using semicolons or multiple dashes, for example, can impair readability and can make translation difficult.
-  Use the serial (Oxford) comma to provide clarity and to maintain consistency across content. Use a comma for a series of three or more elements.
-  Don't use end punctuation (``. : ! ?``) in section titles, subheadings, UI titles, and items in a list that are three or fewer words.
-  Don't use a comma to combine two independent clauses (comma splicing). Instead, add a conjunction (like "and") or separate the clauses into two sentences. For example, *"I sent 100 emails, I plan to send 100 more"* could instead be either:
    - *"I sent 100 emails, and I plan to send 100 more."*
    - *"I sent 100 emails. I plan to send 100 more."*

### Capitalisation

Sentence case involves capitalising only the first word and proper nouns.

There has been a shift to using sentence case in headings, except for global (primary) headers in a website, otherwise known as top-level navigation. This is because sentence case is easier to read, has a friendlier tone, and helps distinguish proper nouns from common nouns. 

Most technology concepts, product categories, devices, features, and components are common nouns. Keeping features lowercase helps companies avoid over-capitalising. A company might make exceptions for features that:
- Are sold separately.
- Are trademarked.
- Need to be distinguished from the general meaning of the same word for understanding.
- Are named using a word that has a known meaning that’s very different from what it means in the product.

In general, use sentence case for: 

-  Headlines, headers, and subheads.
-  Secondary web navigation and menu items.
-  Buttons and calls to action (CTA).
-  Titles and input fields.
-  Titles of charts, tables, and diagrams.
-  List items.

Use title case only for:

-  Main or global navigation on webpages (top-level or primary navigation).
-  Distinguishing features and products from general technology with similar names (for example, SQL Server from SQL database server).
-  Titles of books, podcasts, webinars, and videos.
-  Trademarked product names.

### Present tense

Use the present tense to describe product behavior.When you need to write in past tense, use simple verb forms.

Present tense is more direct, easier to read, and results in shorter sentences, for example, "your list is then updated" instead of “your list will then be updated".

Using present tense also naturally reduces the use of words that leave room for interpretation, such as “should”, which obscures whether an action is required, optional, a suggestion, or something that will definitely happen, for example, “You should then see a new list” versus “A new list opens”.

### Contractions

Use common negation and present-tense contractions. This is because contractions:

- Result in shorter sentences.
- Are easier to read.
- Are harder to misinterpret.
- Are more human-friendly.

This is especially important for phrases that include the word “not”. Use “don’t” instead of “do not” as an alternative way of ensuring people don’t scan over the word “not”. Reserve bolding for referring to UI elements.

Avoid:
- Contractions formed from nouns and verbs, for example, “Saving’s effective”.
- Double contractions, such as “mightn’t’ve”.
- Confusing “its” (possessive) with “it’s” (noun + verb).

### Headings

Headings help the use scan content by breaking up a page into sections and signposting those sections.

-  Keep headings (headlines and subheadings) short, clear, and to the point. 
-  Use action verbs whenever possible. 
-  Choose clarity over cleverness.
-  Highlight the main point of your content to give the reader a good sense of what they’re about to read.
-  Create a benefit-driven statement written in conversational language.  
-  Keep your headline as short as possible, using a subheading to dive into the details.

### Lists

Use lists to present steps, groups, or sets of information:

-  Use bullets, not numbers, when the order of the list doesn’t matter. 
-  Number a list when the order is important, like describing steps of a process. 
-  Capitalise the first word of a list item. 
-  If a list includes independent, complete sentences, use proper closing punctuation. 
-  Don’t add a full stop to the end of a list item if it’s not a complete sentence or if it contains fewer than four words.

Long lists of bullets are no easier to read than big blocks of text. So keep bulleted items:

* Short
* Related
* Consistent in style
* Eight items or fewer

Consider grouping longer lists into themes and under different subheadings. 

### Links

A link is an interactive reference to other (relevant and trusted) content or external resources that the user can access by selecting it. Guidelines for links include:

- Don't link preceding articles (a, an, the).
- Don't link punctuation.
- Ensure the link looks different from regular text.
- Include a hover state that communicates the link's interactivity.
- Write a normal sentence and link the relevant words in it.
- Don't include phrases like "Click here" on a link.

### Symbols

Don't use symbols or characters to substitute words:

-  Use "or" instead of ``/``. Forward slashes reduce specificity in sentences and aren’t good for screen readers. Reserve ``/`` for code, URLs, and file paths.
-  Use "and" instead of ``&`` unless space is extremely limited in the UI, for example, in tab labels or screen titles. Reserve ``&`` for code, URLs, and company names.
-  Use "more than" and "less than" instead of ``>`` and ``<`` unless space is extremely limited in UI labels.
-  Only use ``+`` when you're adding a technical command or to indicate a count that exceeds a specific number when space is limited in the UI, for example, "30+ degrees".
-  Only use ``"`` when you're adding a technical command or to represent inches, for example, 10"x10".
-  Only use ``x`` when you're adding a technical command; don't use the letter ``x`` to indicate a multiplication sign.

> **Note:** 
>
> "And" and "&" aren't synonymous. In code, “and” is a logical operator; “&” is a concatenation operator. In everyday language, “&” is the equivalent of writing “u r” instead of “you are” or “you’re”. Using “&” isn’t just *less* formal, it’s *too* informal. 

Use "percent" with a number for specifying a quantity (for example, 5 percent) and "percentage" without a number.
- Spell out the word "percent" (instead of using the ``%`` symbol), unless it's in a heading, chart, or table, the content is data-intensive, you need to save space, or it's being used as a technical symbol.
- Use a space between the written number and the word "percent".
- Don't use spaced between a number written as a figure and the `%` symbol, for example, "5%".
-  Use "percent" without a number in column headings.
-  For a sequence, add the `%` symbol after both numbers and use the same number of decimal places, for example “5.25% to 7.50%”.
- Describe the difference in percentages as percentage points. For example, if you have two percentage numbers, 2% and 4%, the percentage point difference is 2 pp whereas the percentage difference is 100%.

### Numbers and measurements

Spell out numbers from zero through to nine in the main body of text unless:
- The number is a measurement, for example, 8 px.
- The number is technical or precise, for example, 0.75.
- It’s a number that the user is directed to enter, for example, “Enter the number 5”.
- The number is part of date, for example, May 9.
- The number crosses a boundary, for example, 5 to 10 minutes.

Use figures:
-  For 10 and above.
-  For numbers in headlines.
-  Before million, billion, and trillion (for example, 1 million).
-  For specific dates, time, and measurements (for example, 5 minutes), unless that number is at the beginning of a sentence.

Use abbreviations for units of measure, except time unless space is limited. If using abbreviations:
- Keep in mind that abbreviations are always singular.
- Don’t use hyphens between numerals and the abbreviation or symbol.

Insert a space between the number and the unit of measure, unless:
- Using the `%` symbol.
- Reporting a temperature.
- Referring to positive or negative numbers.

Other guidelines:
- Avoid using hyphens for a range of numbers. Use “to” instead.
- Use “0” where there is no digit before a decimal point, for example, 0.6.
- Don’t abbreviate the word “number” to “#”.
- Use a comma for large numbers, except when referring to pixels, page numbers, or years.


### Dashes and hyphens

In general, avoid dashes. These are often used inconsistently and incorrectly.

- Hyphenate compound modifiers that act as adjectives, for example, "a high-definition user experience".
- Don't use a hyphen with adverbs ending in -ly, for example, "a highly mobile worker".
- Use em dashes (––) like parentheses, but don’t overuse them. Typically, you can use commas or create new sentences instead.
- Use an en dash (–) to indicate a minus sign or a negative number.

For a range, use “to” instead of a dash or hyphen, for example "2 to 5 events". If not using the word "to", use an en dash (–) without spaces on either side, for example, "pages 95–110".

### Acronyms and abbreviations

Use shortened forms with care. 

Reserve acronyms and abbreviations for when space is limited or for when users are more familiar with the acronym or abbreviation than the phrase it's based on (for example, URL). When you do use acronyms and abbreviations:

-  Don't capitalise the words on which the acronym is based unless referring to a proper noun.
-  Avoid using the possessive form with abbreviations and acronyms.
-  Use the proper article with an acronym in the sentence.
-  Don't use an apostrophe for the plural of an acronym.
-  Avoid using abbreviations and acronyms for the first time in a title or heading, unless the abbreviation or acronym is a keyword, in which case, introduce the acronym in parenthesis following the full phrase it's based on.
-  Use abbreviations for a unit of measurement.
	-  If an abbreviation matches a preposition, include a period after. For example, "3 ft, 5 in."
	-  Insert a space between the number and the unit of measure.

In technical documentation, spell out acronyms on first reference. Include the acronym in parentheses immediately following the expanded form unless it's a long-established acronym (for example, HTML).
