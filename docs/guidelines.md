# Writing Guidelines

Following a set of writing guidelines helps ensure consistency, content quality, and a good user experience of product documentation and UI content. The writing guidelines presented in this article are based on substantial research, content design principles, UX writing expertise, and industry standards.

You can apply the **Lean writing principles**, guidelines for **Word choice**, and **Writing conventions** to both technical writing and UX writing.

## Lean writing principles

Write clearly, precisely, and concisely to make content easier to read and understand.

### Keep content short and simple

- Separate different points or thoughts into different sentences.
- Use common contractions, such as "don't" instead of "do not".
- Use short and simple, everyday words, such as "help" instead of "assistance".
- Write short sentences, and keep to a limit:
    - For online documentation, write sentences that are no more than 28 words.
    - For UI content, write sentences that are no more than 15 words.

### Write purposeful content

Write every sentence and choose every word with purpose, direction, and meaning.

- Write only to say something relevant that the reader or user can use.
- Don't write to fill space.
- Don't provide unnecessary context or detail.
- Don't tell the reader how to think or feel; allow the reader to think or feel based on what you write.

### Get to the point, quicker

Follow these tips to get to the point in your communication with readers.

|Tip | Example |
|---|---|
|Avoid buried verbs (or nominalisation; using a noun and a verb when a verb alone would portray the meaning).  | "Follow the guidelines for testing your software", rather than "Follow the guidelines for *performing a test of* your software". Turning the word "test" into an action removed the need for the word "performing".|
|Omit prepositional phrases. | "Select the plus sign ~~in order~~ to add new user" or "The solution ~~in this case~~ is to delete the file." |
|Use adverbs in place of prepositional phrases.  | "This allows you to use the app effectively", rather than "This allows you to use the app *with great effectiveness*". |
|Replace prepositional phrases with the possessive.| "Find the computer's instructions", rather than "Find *the instructions for the computer*".|
|Use the active voice, which is more direct and easier to understand than the passive voice. |"You can send emails from your phone", rather than "Emails *can be sent from* your phone".|
|Write imperative sentences. | "If you need further help, ~~you can~~ contact the Support team". |
|Avoid grammatical expletives (words that add emphasis by delaying the subject), such as "it is" or "there are". |"There are six items in the list", could be reworded to "The list has six items".|

## Word choice

Use clear, consistent, and human language.

### Use unambiguous terms

-  Use terms that are clear and understood by global audiences without need of special or local cultural knowledge.
-  "Would", "should", and "may" can be ambiguous in describing whether something *will*, *must*, or *can* be done.
-  Don't use double-negatives, for example, use "like" instead of "not unlike".

### Use plain English

-  Avoid marketing language and technical jargon.
-  Use industry-standard terminology when it will improve user understanding.
-  Spend time researching what words the intended readers use rather than defaulting to corporate language.
-  Use intended words instead of Latin abbreviations, such as "specifically" instead of "i.e.".

### Use terminology consistently

-  Don't switch between terms in the product documentation or in the product itself.
-  Don't switch back and forth between full words and acronyms or abbreviations.
-  In instructions, refer to UI elements exactly as they appear in the product.

### Use unbiased language

You're talking to humans, so be sensitive to the human meaning of words.

-  Avoid offensive or violent terms, like "abort", "hit", "force", "reject", "kill", "hang", and "terminate". For example, instead of *"Kill your session"*, use *"End your session"*.
-  Avoid terms that reflect historical racial bias, such as:
	- The presumption of colour-coding to dichotomise good and bad in terms of black and white (for example, blacklist, whitelist).
	- References that carry forward the master/slave paradigm (for example, master table).

## Writing conventions

This section provides guidance on some of the mechanics of technical writing, like punctuation, capitalization, and lists –– the individual elements that help make content clear and understandable.

### Punctuation

Punctuation steps in to provide meaning in the absence of the rhythm, intonation, and pauses in speech that would otherwise offer clarity.

-  Keep punctuation simple. Complex constructions, using semicolons or multiple dashes, for example, can impair readability and can make translation difficult.
-  Use the serial (Oxford) comma to provide clarity and to maintain consistency across content. Use a comma for a series of three or more elements.
-  Don't use end punctuation (``. : ! ?``) in section titles, subheadings, UI titles, and items in a list that are three or fewer words.
-  Use full stops only in paragraphs and body copy.
-  Don't use a comma to combine two independent clauses (comma splicing). Instead, add a conjunction (like "and") or separate the clauses into two sentences. For example, *"I sent 100 emails, I plan to send 100 more"* could instead be either:
    - *"I sent 100 emails, and I plan to send 100 more"*
    - *"I sent 100 emails. I plan to send 100 more"*

### Capitalisation

There has been a recent shift to using sentence case in headings, except for global (primary) headers in a website, otherwise known as top-level navigation. This is because sentence case is easier to read. Sentence case involves capitalising only the first word and proper nouns in a heading.

In general, use sentence case for: 

-  Headlines, headers, and subheads.
-  Titles of documents.
-  Secondary web navigation and menu items.
-  Buttons and calls to action.
-  Titles and fields on forms. 
-  Titles of charts, tables, and diagrams.
-  List items.

This leaves title case only for:

-  Main or global navigation on webpages (top-level/primary navigation).
-  Distinguishing products from general technology with similar names (for example, SQL Server from SQL database server).
-  Titles of books, podcasts, webinars, and videos.
-  Trademarked product names.

### Headings

-  Keep headings (headlines and subheadings), short, clear, and to the point. 
-  Use action verbs whenever possible. 
-  Choose clarity over cleverness.
-  Highlight the main point of your content and give the reader a good sense of what they’re about to read. 
-  Create a benefit-driven statement written in conversational language.  
-  Keep your headline as short as possible, using a subheading to dive into the details if necessary.

Subheads can be used to: 
- Pay off a headline
- Help with scanning by signposting sections of a page
- Break up a page into sections

### Lists

Use lists to present steps, groups, or sets of information:

-  Use bullets, not numbers, when the order of the list doesn’t matter. 
-  Number a list when the order is important, like describing steps of a process. 
-  Capitalise the first word of a list item. 
-  Don’t add a full stop to the end of a list item if it’s not a complete sentence. 
-  If a list includes standalone, complete sentences, use proper closing punctuation. 

### Acronyms and abbreviations

Use shortened forms with care:

-  Spell out acronyms and include the acronym in parentheses immediately following the expanded form on first reference in online documentation unless it's a long-established acronym (for example, HTML).
-  Don't capitalise the words on which the acronym is based unless it is a proper noun.
-  Avoid using the possessive form with abbreviations and acronyms.
-  Use the proper article with an acronym in the sentence.
-  Don't use an apostrophe for the plural of an acronym.
-  Avoid using abbreviations and acronyms for the first time in a title or heading, unless the abbreviation or acronym is a keyword, in which case, introduce the acronym in parenthesis following the full phrase it is based on.
-  Reserve abbreviations and acronyms for when space is limited or for when users are more familiar with the abbreviation or acronym than the phrase it is based on (for example, URL)
-  Use abbreviations for a unit of measurement.
	-  If an abbreviation matches a preposition, include a period after (for example, 3 ft, 5 in.).
	-  Insert a space between the number and the unit of measure

### Symbols

Don't use symbols or characters to substitute words:

-  Use "or" instead of ``/``.
-  Use "and" instead of ``&`` unless space is extremely limited in the UI, for example, for tab labels or screen titles.
 -  Use "more than" and "less than"  instead of ``>`` and ``<`` unless space is extremely limited in UI labels.
 -  Only use ``+`` when you're adding a technical command or to indicate a count that exceeds a specific number when space is limited in the UI, for example, 30+ degrees
-  Only use ``"`` when  you're adding a technical command or to represent inches, for example, 10"x10"
-  Only use ``x`` when  you're adding a technical command; don't use the letter ``x`` to indicate a multiplication sign
-  Use an en dash (``-``) to indicate a minus sign or a hyphen	
-  Use "percent" with a number (for example, 5 percent) and "percentage" without a number.
	- Spell out the word "percent" (instead of using the `%` symbol), unless it's in a heading or table.
	- Alway use a number with "percent" unless the number is the first word in a sentence
	- Use a space between the number and the word "percent".

### Numbers

-  In the main body of text:
    -  Spell out numbers from zero through to nine.
    -  Use figures for 10 and above.
-  Use figures for numbers in headlines.
-  Use figures before million, billion, and trillion (for example, 1 million).
-  Use figures for specific dates, time, and measurements (for example, 5 minutes), unless that number is at the beginning of a sentence.

### Dashes and hyphens

- Hyphenate compound modifiers that act as adjectives, for example, "A high-definition user experience"
- Don't use a hyphen with adverbs ending in -ly, for example, "A highly mobile worker"
- Use em dashes (—) like parentheses, but don’t overuse them. 
- Be careful not to substitute an en dash (–) for an em dash.
- Use an en dash (–) to indicate a: 
	- Minus sign  
	- Negative number
	- Range of numbers (For example, pages 95–110). 

# Technical writing guidelines

Before writing technical content for product documentation, you should:

-  Understand the user persona: whether they're network, IT, or security administrators, security officers, end-users, or data analysts.
-  Change the way you write based on the users and their expectations. Be aware of goals, needs, and backgrounds. Decide on the tone you use based on the product and target audience.
-  Understand at what stage in the customer journey the user is when they read your content.
-  Understand the product: narrow your perspective down to the specific functionality that requires content.

## Product knowledge guidelines

To write clear and accurate content: 

-  Develop in-depth knowledge of the product.
-  Understand the real-world use cases for the product or feature.
-  Understand the solution provided by the product or feature.
-  Identify the competitors and what the product or feature differentiator is.
-  Consider globalisation standards (strings can be 2 times longer; content can be translated in an unfavourable way).
-  Create content based on a hands-on experience with the product or feature.
-  When writing content, walk through design flow the way a user would and document as you perform the steps.

## Writing product documentation

**Get straight to the point based on what users want and need:**

-  Eliminate redundancy, such as titles that restate the body of an information box in the UI or a paragraph in documentation.
-  Don't provide unnecessary information. For example, don't give a detailed history the product –– focus on what's new in the particular service and instructions for performing a specific task.
-  Remove unnecessary words and content.

**Make content easy to scan for relevant information:**

-  Keep it short and simple.
    -  Keep content as short as possible to the reduce the need for users to scroll. 
    -  Aim for paragraphs that are 75 words or fewer.
    -  Sentences should be, on average, 15 words, and 28 words as a maximum.
    -  Use shorter and less complicated words where possible.
    -  Keep headings 12 words or fewer.
-  Break up content.
    -  Use headings.
    -  Adopt flat hierarchy (2-3 tiers).
    -  Write short blocks of text (2-4 sentences).
    -  Use bullet points.
- Consider the location of content.
    -  Place important content "above the fold" in a webpage.
    -  In left-to-right languages, people tend to read in an F shape, so place important content or navigation in the top left.
- Use emphasis very selectively.
    -  Typically, we use bolding to call out UI elements and to place emphasis on specific actions. 
    -  Don't use italics or quotation marks for emphasis.

**Avoid redundancy to maintain the effectiveness of your content.**

Use as few words as possible to portray meaning.

-  Remove unnecessary modifiers. For example, "The set up is ~~basically~~ the same" or "The process is ~~quite~~ straightforward".
-  Prune every excess word. For example, "*Repeat* the steps ~~*again*~~" or "*Revert ~~back~~* to your previous settings.".
-  Remove empty modifiers, for example, *"Selecting this option is ~~really~~ only needed if you're using a Windows machine."*
-  Replace an intensifier or qualifier, along with the adjective it refers to, with a stronger word, for example, *"very important"* could be replaced with *"crucial"*.
-  Avoid manner adverbs (usually formed from adjectives by adding "-ly") and use precise language, instead. For example, *"The change takes effect quickly"*, could instead be *"The change takes effect within 5 minutes"*.

## Writing instructional content

**Bullets and numbering.** Use a numbered list to denote the order in which steps are carried out; use bullet points for a general list.

**Emphasis.** Use bolding to call out UI elements and to place emphasis on specific actions, such as **Select**, **Delete**, and **Save**. 

**Style.** Use the imperative mood for instructions. Sentences with an imperative mood start with an action verb and second person singular, with "you" as its implied subject. Imperative sentences are typically in the active voice. 

**Click-throughs.** Use chevrons (**>**) with spaces around them to separate items in a click-through; bold the chevrons. For example, *"To create a shareable link, navigate to the top menu and select **File > Share > Copy Link**"*.

**Terminology.** Use the word **click** only to refer to specific mouse actions; in general, avoid talking about mouse actions. Instead, refer to user actions with words like "hover over", "point to", "select", "choose", and "enter". 
 -  Use **select** to instruct the reader to select an item, like text, objects, or cells. 
 -  Use **enter** to instruct the user to type their password or choose a selection from a dialogue box.

|Sentence structure | Example|
|---|---|
|Put conditional clauses before instructions. |*"For more information, see the disclosure document"* (rather than *"See the disclosure document for more information"*). |
|To direct the user to do something, mention the circumstances before you provide the instruction. |*"If you want a PDF of this page, select the **Download** button in the top-right of the screen"* (rather than *"Select the **Download** button in the top-right of the screen for a PDF of this page"*).|
|When writing a series of steps, mention the location, followed by the action. |*"From the drop-down menu, select the type of alert you want to send"* (rather than *"Select the type of alert you want to send from the dropdown menu"*). |

# UX writing guidelines

General guidance for UX writing include:

-  Engage early with Product Design (PD).
-  Set the strategy early in your writing.
-  Take a user-centred approach.
-  Keep messages short.
-  Use voice, tone, and terminology consistently across different modes.
-  Use first person references to address the reader directly; avoid referring to "users" or "customers".
-  Avoid using the same word twice in the same screen.
-  Use one word for CTA and text buttons unless there is a verb involved.
-  Avoid negative words.
-  Use sentence case for everything except global navigation and boolean values.

More specific guidance depends on the type of UX writing you're engaged in.

## UX writing categories

The main categories of UX writing are:

### Micro copy

Micro copy refers to the words or very short sentences that tell a user what to do, address user concerns, and provide context to a situation. Examples of micro copy include: title bars, buttons, menus, error messages, labels, supplementary explanations, checkbox options, dropdown lists, row/column headings and entries, and so on.

### Contextual help

Contextual help is on-demand content based on the state that an application is in when a user seeks help, such as instructions, tooltips, guided workflows, and so on. Help that is offered in context is easier to identify and use (has high affordance) and us less disruptive; rather than interrupt the workflow by forcing the user to browse an online manual or help centre, context-sensitive help delivers content relevant to the part of the program that the user is interacting with. It is thus better if the user can access this help without leaving the current workflow, which can achieved with **in-product instructions**.

### In-product instructions

In-product instructions (or on-screen text) are contextual help presented inline with the interface content, which avoid making users switch between tools to get help. They help the user understand what a feature does or how to populate a field. This allows the user to solve problems without waiting for assistance or referring to a user manual, reducing the number of incoming queries to the support team.

In-product instructions are the least demanding way to offer support because they prevent the user from having to rely on working memory or from having to take an extra step to find information. To maximise the chances of positive experience, in-product assistance should:

-  Cause minimal disruption to the user's workflow.
-  Result in quick issue or query resolution.
-  Foster ease-of-use.
-  Be timely and well-placed, appearing the moment the user needs them and embedded directly in the interface.
-  Provide **progressive disclosure**.

## Progressive disclosure philosophy

Progressive disclosure is an interaction design pattern that sequences information and actions across screens and reveals only essential information. This avoids overwhelming the user and helps them manage complexity. It also makes products easier to learn and use, avoids frustration and confusion, and reduces the number of potential errors. Some guidelines include:

-  Don't bombard the user with a lot of information as soon as they're introduced to the product.
-  Allow the information to progress naturally, from simple to complex.
-  Help the user move from completing tasks with essential information to completing more complex tasks with additional info.
-  Build upon each subsequent step of information experience and learning.
-  Provide only the necessary information for the user to take each action, one at a time.

With the progressive disclosure philosophy in mind, the UX writer should consider when to use the following types of micro copy and contextual help to guide the user as part of an in-product strategy. You can decide on the type of copy you're providing based on the required level of detail.

### On-screen copy (inline instruction)

On-screen copy is brief text that appears on the page, alongside the UI element it references, and it is used when the information is:

-  Essential to performing the task.
-  Directly actionable. 

If there is enough space, the UX writer might also decide to include:

-  Important but not directly actionable information
-  Supplementary information, preventing the user from having to navigate elsewhere to find it

Embedding information directly within a feature in this way is often the best choice for providing contextual help. It can, however, make the interface look cluttered or might not provide enough information to be useful. If this is the case, consider using **tooltips**.

### Tooltips

Tooltips are user-triggered, brief informative messages that appear when the user interacts with a UI element by clicking or hovering over it. Tooltips are offered when additional content might help the user make more informed decisions based on specific, contextual information. They typically provide a short description of the element or functionality that users might want or need to know more about; tooltips disappear, and so they shouldn't be used for directly-actionable or essential information required to perform a task.

Tooltips are useful with:

-  Unlabelled controls and command buttons with graphic labels.
-  Labelled controls and UI elements that benefit from supplemental information that doesn't fit as on-screen text.
-  As a form of progressive disclosure with help (?) and info (i) icons, eliminating the need for descriptive text on screen if not essential to the primary task.

### Walk-throughs (guided help)

A series of messages or tooltips appearing one at a time to provide step-by-step instructions that will guide a user through a feature, used when the functionality or workflow is more complex or spread across multiple pages. A walk-through provides step-by-step guidance and instructions.

### Page-level help

Context-sensitive topics that are triggered when the user selects a link provided at page level, used when the user might need conceptual or bigger-picture information (such as UI use cases) to help them understand the page that the user is on. This provides users with a way of getting detailed information without having to navigate or search different sites.

## Writing and reviewing UI content

Before writing or reviewing UI content, the UX writer needs to know:

-  Who they're writing for, such as end-users or administrators.
-  How the product is used. 
-  What the use cases are.
-  What components of the product need written or reviewed (if not the end-to-end experience).

### Guidelines for tooltips

The text in a tooltip must be informative. You should aim to:

-  Avoid redundant information.
-  Provide helpful content.
-  Provide information that isn't otherwise obvious and doesn't repeat on-screen copy.
-  Focus on the control's action, for example, by beginning the tag with a verb.

Tooltip text should provide additional and useful information, such as why a field is required or what will be done using the value entered into a field. Other guidelines for using tooltips include:

-  Use the fewest words possible.
	-  For labelled controls, limit tooltips to 15 words (if more text is need, this suggests that the design is too complicated).
	-  For tooltips triggered by clicking help icons, limit text to no more than 40 words (if more content is required, consider adding a Learn more link to the exact documentation, but use such links sparingly, which you might achieve by including one link at the page level).
-  If you need to reduce the length of a tag, omit grammatical articles.
-  Keep in mind that localisation can lengthen text by 20 to 30 percent.

Tooltips used in touchscreen devices are called popup tips, following the same guidelines as tooltips, except that they require a specific initiation/termination method.

### Guidelines for instructional text

**Keep it simple.** Don't overuse instructional UI text; copy should enhance the experience, not clutter it.

-  Don't explain fundamental features; if a user needs instructions, consider making the service design more intuitive.
-  Don't explain obvious features and workflow (instructional text will get in the way of an already intuitive workflow).
-  Don't make users engage with instructional text; users should be free to ignore instructional UI and still progress through it.
-  Don't repeat information; add a setting to display instructional UI instead.

**Keep it useful.** Use instructional text to make the onboarding flow as smooth as possible
	
-  The most immediate instructions should be those that apply to every page.
-  Focus on the actions that the user needs to take.
-  Provide information about prerequisites and next steps.
-  Ensure warnings are relevant to the task.
-  Include tips that might help the user complete their task.

### Guidelines for UI messages

In general, messages should:

-  Be written in a consistent style.
-  Be friendly.
-  Use simple language.
-  Provide sufficient and not excessive information.
-  Avoid jargon and technical detail; if technical detail might be wanted or needed, use progressive disclosure.
-  Suggest next steps.

If a product requires an extended activity, direct the user with clear, conversational language, for example, *"Do you need more time?"*

For error messages:

-  Use a language that encourages the user to come back or try again. 
-  Turn error messages and 404 pages into positive reinforcement by guiding the user along until they complete their task. 
-  Focus on the solution, not the error or mistake.
-  Don't blame the user.
-  Be kind to users who encounter situations in the product UI that could be frustrating for them, such as 404 pages.
-  Use missteps as an opportunity to encourage users to keep navigating through the product.

Avoid overusing "please", "thank you", and "sorry", especially for normal operations of the program:

-  Use "please" only in situations where you're asking someone to do something inconvenient or where the software is at fault.
-  Use "thank you" when you're asking someone to provide input that is inconvenient or difficult to get.
-  Use "sorry" only in situations that cause serious problems for the user, such as data loss.

General recommendations for each element of a message, whichever type it is, are:

-  For titles, use sentence case capitalisation and no ending punctuation, unless the statement is a question.
-  For the message body, use complete sentences, sentence case capitalisation, and ending punctuation.
-  For the buttons, use sentence case punctuation but no end punctuation, and use short, action verbs unless the buttons require a simple **Yes | No**.

### Guidelines for UI elements

-  Use a logical order for UI elements. Avoid alphabetical (because it is language-dependent) unless no other order can be found.
-  Don't use "click here" on a link.
-  Avoid using abbreviations and acronyms in UI content unless space is severely limited or the acronym is better known than the full term (for example, URL).
-  Use "percent" without a number in column headings.
-  Use the the `%` symbol in UI, charts, and table cells, or as a technical symbol.
