# Voice and tone

Voice and tone are determined by the individual components that make up the content, like the words and phrases we use (and don't use), sentence structure, writing conventions, viewpoint, and the progression of information.

## Differentiating voice and tone

The difference between voice and tone is similar to the difference between "traits" and "states" in human psychology. You can be a friendly person (trait), but also exhibit more or less friendliness (as a transient state) depending on the situation or who you're interacting with. 

With this in mind, the main differences between voice and tone are as follows:

|Voice|Tone|
|---|---|
| The character or persona. | The attitude or emotional inflection. |
| Remains stable. | Changes based on context.
| How you talk to customers in all communications. | How you talk to different audiences at different times.|

**Voice** captures the persona behind the content or its "character". Voice should be delivered with consistency across content. If your personality or messaging change too much or too often, itâ€™s harder for readers to understand the purpose of the content or to trust it.

**Tone** captures the "attitude" with which we express content. It's often described as the "emotional inflection" applied to the voice. This should change based on the target audience, context, and the reader's likely state of mind.

For example, you can adopt a professional yet friendly voice across platforms, but you can also be more or less professional or friendly depending on the situation and audience (tone).

In-app error messages, for example, might call for friendlier language, such as *"It looks like your passwords don't match. Try again?"* to put the user at ease when they encounter a problem. Compare this with a phrase like *"Ensure that you've entered the correct password twice"* in the product documentation. Both examples use short sentences, contractions, and second person, achieving clarity and a more human feel (voice), but the tone is different.

## Consolidating voice and tone: tone of voice

At first, the difference between voice and tone might seem obvious, but there is also disagreement. Some sources argue that "voice" is *what* you write and "tone" is *how* you write it. Others define voice and tone based on what aspects of your writing can change based on context (tone) and what aspects should stay the same (voice).

The [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/brand-voice-above-all-simple-human) (2018) says that voice is *how* you say something and that tone is *an aspect of* voice, alongside personality, substance, and style. Under this logic, voice is made up of a group of multiple features or is a delivery mechanism for these features.

If voice and tone don't operate independently, it's perhaps more useful to consider them jointly in making decisions about writing style rather than separating them. Specifically, it makes sense to define voice as the parameter within which tone can operate.

Rather than attempting to reconcile the differences in opinion about the precise nature of voice and tone in writing, this documentation refers to them as a single concept: **tone of voice**.

## Formality, professionalism, and user-friendliness

For both documentation and in-product content, information developers must strike a balance between user-friendliness and professionalism, achieved in part by following the appropriate **tone of voice** guidelines.

Professional isn't the same as formal. You can write clearly and simply, and thus write less formally, without losing the credibility needed for technical documentation and in-product guidance. The aim is to be neutral and objective, whilst also being accessible and friendly.

Formality in writing is a spectrum. Scientific and academic papers typically use third person and tend to avoid contractions, making them more formal and impersonal than you might aim for in documentation and in-product content. 

In product documentation and UX writing, it's more important to avoid fatigue and frustration; we want the text to be as direct and understandable as possible for helping the reader get the job done. We thus aim to write in plain English, short sentences, and a conversational style, whilst also maintaining a level of professionalism and authority.

## Tone of voice guidelines

The sections below provide guidelines for the proposed tone of voice for both product documentation and UI content. Tone of voice is based on the purpose of content and the intended audiences. The high-level goals for tone of voice include:

- Be clear (direct, simple, precise, and concise)
- Be human (conversational, personal, positive, and inclusive)
- Be useful (objective, user-centric, action-oriented, and goal-focused)

Some of the guidelines for meeting these goals overlap. For example, using the second person ("you") makes it easier to write in the active voice (**be clear**), helps establish a conversational style (**be human**), and makes the content directly relevant to the reader (**be useful**).

> **Note:** 
>
> While everyday contractions are encouraged because they're easier to read, avoid less common or colloquial contractions, such as "that'd" instead of "that would", or "mightn't" instead of "might not". These latter examples are *harder* to read and reduce the level of formality too much.

### Be clear

Keep sentences short and simple with [lean writing principles](/style-guide?id=lean-writing-principles). Reduce wordiness and ambiguity about who or what initiates an action, especially in procedural steps, by using the second person with the imperative mood and active voice.

Other tips for writing clearly include:

-  Get to the point quickly.
-  Use plain English and use simple words where possible.
-  Be consistent
-  Break up content to make it more scannable.
-  Break up sentences into separate thoughts.
-  Check every word for redundancy and remove excess words, *but* also aim for clarity over brevity.

Avoid:

-  Culture-specific references, including idioms, colloquial language, regionalisms, and slang.
-  Phrases with indirect, ironic, or humorous meaning, which can be misinterpreted or irritating.
- Long and complicated sentences.
- Marketing and sales language.
- Technical jargon.
- Ambiguous terms. See [Word choice guidelines](https://jeunese.github.io/#/style-guide?id=word-choice-guidelines) for a list of ambiguous words and phrases to avoid.

|Guidance | Examples | 
|---|---|
|Write in the active voice, where the subject of the sentence performs the action (subject + verb + object construction).| "You can send emails from your phone", rather than "Emails *can be sent from* your phone".|
|Be specific and accurate. | Instead of "This can take a while to process", be more precise with a sentence like: "This can take up to 24 hours to process". |
| Clarify antecedents to avoid or clarify "this", "that", "these", and "it". Restate the noun or use a more specific term. | "Select the gear icon to edit your profile settings. This allows you to change your user name and personal details" could instead be written as follows: "Select the gear icon to edit your profile. *These settings* allow you to change your user name and personal details". |
| Keep the precise meaning of words in mind and use the least ambiguous alternatives. | Use "after" instead of "once", which can also refer to a single occurrence of something; use "might" or "can" instead of "may", which can also imply permission; use "because" instead of "since", which can also imply a period of time. |
| Don't remove relative pronouns such as "that" and "which", even though it shortens the sentence. | "Save items *that* you want to keep."

### Be human

Keep your style informal and natural, even if relaying technical information to more tech-savvy users.

-  Use simple, everyday language.
-  Be direct and conversational.
-  Talk *to* users, not at them.
-  Adopt a personal style.
-  Be friendly and positive.

Avoid:
-  Being too informal.
-  Being patronising.
-  Biased langauge, such as, referring to a specific gender when talking about the user.
-  Overusing niceties such as please, thank you, and sorry. The emphasis should be on being direct and helpful. For more information, see [Be considerate, not over-polite](https://jeunese.github.io/#/style-guide?id=be-considerate-not-over-polite).

|Guidance | Examples | 
|---|---|
|Use common contractions to make content easier to read and less formal. | Use "can't" instead of "cannot" or "can not", "you're" instead of "you are", "it's" instead of "it is".|
|Choose short, simple, everyday words over long, formal, or complicated words. | Use "help" instead of "assistance"; "let" instead of "enable"; "use" instead of "utilise"; "more" instead of "further".|
|Address readers directly to establish a personal tone. Use the second person in sentences. | Use "you" instead of "the administrator", "the customer", or "the user". |
|Look out for words like "can't" and "don't" to re-frame sentences more positively.|"Sign in again to reconnect" instead of "You *can't* reconnect until you sign in again"|

### Be useful

Make your content about the reader or user. Make it obvious why content is relevant to the reader or user, and how they can act on it.

-  Focus on the benefit first, and the product second.
-  Focus on what matters for the reader or user.
-  Understand what the reader or user needs to know to meet their goals.
-  Focus on the user's actions more so than the system behaviour or response.
-  Focus on the impact for the reader or user.
-  Suggest next steps for the reader or user.

Avoid:
-  Blaming the reader or user.
-  Redundancy or repetition.
-  Taking a system-centric approach to communicating with users.

|Guidance | Examples | 
|---|---|
|Try starting sentences with a verb and using imperative sentences. | "Access your emails through the browser" rather than "We enable users to access emails through a browser". |
|Refer directly to the reader or user. Use the second person ("you") in sentences about the reader or user. | "You can share your document with others" instead of "Documents can be shared with others". |
|Use the active (as opposed to passive) voice, where possible. This helps makes sentences more user-focused. | "All files can be deleted" written in the active voice becomes: "You can delete all files".|
|Focus on what the user can do, rather than the state of the system.| "If you get no output, investigate the input" rather than "If you get no output, there is a serious issue with the input."|
|Use more verbs and fewer nouns. | "If you decide to..." instead of "If you make a decision to..."; "The system analysed..." instead of "The system conducted an analysis of..." |
