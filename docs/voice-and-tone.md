# Voice and tone

Voice and tone are determined by the individual components that make up the content, like the words and phrases we use (and don't use), sentence structure, viewpoint, and the progression of information.

For example, scientific and academic papers typically use third person and tend to avoid contractions, making it formal and impersonal. 

In product documentation and UX writing, it's more important to avoid fatigue and frustration; we want the text to be as direct and understandable as possible for getting the job done. We thus aim to write in plain English, short sentences, and a conversational style.

## What are voice and tone?

Depending on the source of definitions for voice and tone, the simplest answers are:

|Voice|Tone|
|---|---|
| *What* you say. | *How* you say it. |
| Remains stable. | Changes based on context.
| The character or persona. | The attitude or emotional inflection. |

### Voice

Voice captures the persona behind the content or its "character". Voice should be delivered with consistency across content. If your personality or messaging change too much or too often, itâ€™s harder for readers to understand the purpose of the content or to trust it.

### Tone

Tone captures the "attitude" with which we express content. It is often described as the "emotional inflection" applied to the voice. This should change based on the target audience, context, and the reader's state of mind.

For example, an error message in the UI might call for friendlier language such as *"It looks like your passwords don't match. Try again?"* to put the user at ease. Compare this with a phrase like *"Ensure that you've entered the correct password twice"* in the product documentation. Both examples use short sentences, contractions, and second person, achieving clarity and a more human feel, but the tone is different.

## Voice and tone, or tone of voice?

It can be hard differentiating voice (character) from tone (attitude) with concrete examples. For example, you can adopt a friendly voice across platforms, but you can also be more or less friendly depending on the situation and audience (tone). 

This is similar to the difference between between "traits" and "states" in human psychology. You can be a friendly person (trait), but also exhibit more or less friendliness (as a more transient state) depending on the situation or who you're interacting with.

Adding to the confusion, the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/brand-voice-above-all-simple-human) (2018) says that the *message*, rather than voice, is *what* you say, and that voice is *how* you say it. According to this Microsoft style guide, tone is *an aspect of* voice, alongside personality, substance, and style. Under this logic, voice becomes a group of multiple features or a delivery mechanism for these features.

If voice and tone don't operate independently, it is more useful to consider them jointly in making decisions about writing style rather than attempting separate them. Specifically, it makes sense to define voice as the parameter within which tone can operate. 

Rather than attempting to reconcile the differences in opinion about the precise nature of voice and tone in writing, we refer to them as a single concept in our capacity as technical authors and content designers.

For this reason, we refer to our **tone of voice** rather than "voice and tone" to define our high-level writing goals.

## Our tone of voice

The sections below provide guidelines for the proposed tone of voice of both product documentation and UI content. Our tone of voice is based on the purpose of content and the intended audiences. The high-level goals outlined for tone of voice include:

- Be clear (direct, simple, precise, and concise)
- Be human (conversational, personal, positive, and inclusive)
- Be useful (professional, user-centric, and action-focused)

Some of the guidelines for meeting these goals overlap. For example, using the second person ("you") makes it easier to write in the active voice (be clear), helps establish a conversational style (be human), and makes the content directly relevant to the reader (be useful).

### Be clear

-  Get to the point quickly.
-  Write in plain English.
-  Use simple words where possible.
-  Write in short sentences.
-  Break up sentences into separate thoughts.
-  Reduce wordiness and ambiguity about who or what initiates an action, especially in procedural steps, by using the second person with the imperative mood and active voice.

Avoid:

-  Culture-specific references, including idioms, colloquial language, regionalisms, and slang.
-  Phrases with indirect or ironic meaning.
-  Humour, which can be misinterpreted or irritating.

### Be human

Keep your style informal and natural, even if relaying technical information to more tech-savvy users.

-  Use everyday language.
-  Be direct and conversational; talk *to* users, not at them. 
-  Adopt an informal and personal style.
-  Be friendly and positive.

|Guidance | Examples | 
|---|---|
|Choose short, simple, everyday words over long, formal, or complicated words. | "help" instead of "assistance", "let" instead of "enable", "use" instead of "utilise", "more" instead of "further"|
|Use  contractions to make content easier to read and less formal. | "can't" instead of "cannot" or "can not", "you're" instead of "you are", "it's" instead of "it is"|
|Address readers directly to establish a personal tone. Use the second person in sentences. | "you" instead of "the administrator", "the customer", "the user" |
|Look out for words like "can't" and "don't" to re-frame sentences more positively.|"Sign in again to reconnect" instead of "You *can't* reconnect until you sign in again"|

**Notes on formality:**

* Formality in writing is a spectrum. While everyday contractions are encouraged because they're easier to read, avoid less common or colloquial contractions, such as "that'd" instead of "that would", or "mightn't" instead of "might not". 
* Serious isn't the same as formal. You can write clearly and simply, and thus less formally, without losing the credibility needed for technical (serious) documentation and in-product guidance.

### Be useful

Make your content about the reader or user. Make it obvious why content is relevant to the reader or user, and how they can act on it.

**Refer directly to the reader or user:**

-  Think benefit first, product second.
-  Focus on what matters for the reader or user.
-  Understand what the reader or user needs to know to meet their goals.
-  Use the second person ("you") in sentences about the reader or user.
-  Use the active (as opposed to passive) voice.
-  Focus on the impact for the reader or user
-  Suggest next steps for the reader or user.

**Hone in on the user's actions:**

|Guidance | Examples | 
|---|---|
|Try starting sentences with a verb and using imperative sentences. | "Access your emails through the browser" rather than "We enable users to access emails through a browser." |
|Focus on what the user can do, rather than the state of the system.| "If you get no output, investigate the input" rather than "If you get no output, there is a serious issue with the input."|
|Use more verbs and fewer nouns. | "If you decide to..." instead of "If you make a decision to...", "The system analysed..." instead of "The system conducted an analysis of..." |
|Write in the active voice, where the subject of the sentence performs the action (subject + verb + object construction).| "You can send emails from your phone", rather than "Emails *can be sent from* your phone".|
