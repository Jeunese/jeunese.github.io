# Voice and tone

Depending on the source of definitions for voice and tone, voice is *what* you say and tone is *how* you say it. According to the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/brand-voice-above-all-simple-human)(2018), the *message* is *what* you say, voice is *how* you say it, and tone is one aspect of voice, alongside personality, substance, and style. 

Regardless of the precise semantics, **voice** –– determined by the words and phrases we use (and don't use), sentence structure, the progression of information, and other individual components that make up the content –– remains largely the same. Voice determines the "character" of content, whether it's polite, transparent, optimistic, formal, playful, cold, passive, conversational, direct, and so on, delivered with consistency across content. If your personality or messaging change often, it’s harder for readers to understand the purpose of the content or to trust it.

Meanwhile, **tone** changes based on the target audience, context, and the reader's state of mind. Tone applies "emotional inflection" to the voice. It can be serious, friendly, lighthearted, professional, reassuring, authoritative, fun, and so on. 

For example, scientific and academic papers typically use third person and tend to avoid contractions, giving it a formal voice. However, in product documentation and UX writing, it's more important to avoid fatigue and frustration; we want the text to be as short, friendly, and understandable as possible for getting the job done. We thus aim to write in plain English, short sentences, and a conversational style.

The tone might change a little depending on whether you're writing product documentation or in-product copy. The advice for a pop-up message in the UI, for example, might call for friendlier language to put the user at ease, such as *"It looks like your passwords don't match. Try again?"* in an error message versus *"Ensure that you've entered the correct password twice"* in the product documentation. Both examples use short sentences, contractions, and second person, but their tone is different.

Nevertheless, it can be hard separating voice and tone, and it is generally useful to think of them together.

The sections below provide guidelines for the general voice and tone of both product documentation and UI content. Some of the guidelines overlap. For example, using the second person ("you") makes it easier to write in the active voice (be clear), helps establish a conversational style (be human), and makes the content directly relevant to the reader (be relevant).

## Be clear

-  Get to the point quickly.
-  Write in plain English.
-  Use simple words where possible.
-  Write in short sentences.
-  Break up sentences into separate thoughts.
-  Reduce wordiness and ambiguity about who or what initiates an action, especially in procedural steps, by using the second person with the imperative mood and active voice.

Avoid:

-  Culture-specific references, including idioms, colloquial language, regionalisms, and slang.
-  Phrases with indirect or ironic meaning.
-  Humour, which can be misinterpreted or irritating.

## Be human

Keep your style informal and natural, even if relaying technical information to more tech-savvy users.

-  Use everyday language.
-  Be direct and conversational; talk *to* users, not at them. 
-  Adopt an informal and personal style.
-  Be friendly and positive.

|Guidance | Examples | 
|---|---|
|Choose short, simple words over long, formal, or complicated words. | "help" instead of "assistance", "let" instead of "enable", "use" instead of "utilise", "more" instead of "further"|
|Use everyday words and contractions to make content easier to read and less formal. | "can't" instead of "cannot" or "can not", "you're" instead of "you are", "it's" instead of "it is"|
|Address readers directly to establish a personal tone. Use the second person in sentences. | "you" instead of "the administrator", "the customer", "the user" |
|Look out for words like "can't" and "don't".|"Sign in again to reconnect" instead of "You *can't* reconnect until you sign in again"|

**Notes on formality:**

* Formality in writing is a spectrum. While everyday contractions are encouraged because they're easier to read, avoid less common or colloquial contractions, such as "that'd" instead of "that would", or "mightn't" instead of "might not". 
* Serious isn't the same as formal. You can write clearly and simply, and thus less formally, without losing the credibility needed for technical (serious) documentation and in-product guidance.

## Be relevant

Make your content about the reader or user. Make it obvious why content is relevant to the reader or user, and how they can act on it.

**Focus on the impact for the reader or user:**

-  Think benefit first, product second.
-  Focus on what matters for the reader or user.
-  Understand what the reader or user needs to know to meet their goals.

**Refer directly to the reader or user:**

-  Use the second person ("you") in sentences about the reader or user.
-  Use the active (as opposed to passive) voice.
-  Suggest next steps for the reader or user.

**Hone in on the user's actions:**

|Guidance | Examples | 
|---|---|
|Try starting sentences with a verb and using imperative sentences. | "Access your emails through the browser" rather than "We enable users to access emails through a browser." |
|Focus on what the user can do, rather than the state of the system.| "If you get no output, investigate the input" rather than "If you get no output, there is a serious issue with the input."|
|Use more verbs and fewer nouns. | "If you decide to..." instead of "If you make a decision to...", "The system analysed..." instead of "The system conducted an analysis of..." |
|Write in the active voice, where the subject of the sentence performs the action (subject + verb + object construction).| "You can send emails from your phone", rather than "Emails *can be sent from* your phone".|
