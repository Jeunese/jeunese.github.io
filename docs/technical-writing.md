# Technical Writing Guidelines

## Product documentation

Product documentation covers:

- What the product is and does.
- Why anyone would use the product.
- What the dependencies are.
- How the product relates to other products.
- How and where to get the product.
- How to install the product.
- How to configure the product.
- The end-to-end technical workflow for setting up the product.

Be careful not to repeat Marketing or Sales content. The focus should be on the product's capabilities and use cases.

## Product knowledge guidelines

Before writing technical content for product documentation, you should:

-  Understand the user persona: whether they're: network, IT, or security administrators; security officers; end-users; or data analysts.
-  Change the way you write based on the users and their expectations. Be aware of goals, needs, and backgrounds. Decide on the tone you use based on the product and target audience.
-  Understand at what stage in the customer journey the user is when they read your content.
-  Understand the product: narrow your perspective down to the specific functionality that requires content.

Before writing content, a technical writer first researches and tests the product or feature they are writing about. Communicating the knowledge you garner from research and testing is the last step in the process. 

-  Develop in-depth knowledge of the product.
-  Understand the real-world use cases for the product or feature.
-  Understand the solution provided by the product or feature.
-  Identify the competitors and what the product or feature differentiator is.
-  Consider globalisation standards (strings can be 2 times longer; content can be translated in an unfavourable way).
-  Create content based on a hands-on experience with the product or feature.
-  When writing content, walk through design flow the way a user would and document as you perform the steps.

## Writing product documentation

Once you've learned everything you need to start writing about the product or feature, write only what the administrator needs to know, and no more. Good writing, especially writing that's designed for instruction, should be to the point: clear, precise, and concise. 

### Avoid duplication

Avoid duplication by adopting a single-sourcing model. The following guidelines mean that you should only have to update the documentation in one place.

- Keep content in one place so that you can efficiently manage it.
- Arrange content logically.
- Create self-contained, complete pieces of content that don't overlap ("topics").
- Make liberal use of links to existing content.
- Don't assume someone has read one piece of content before reading another.

### Make content easy to scan for relevant information

The primary purpose of the product documentation is to provide information to the administrator who's looking for it.

**Keep it short and simple:**
-  Keep content as short as possible to the reduce the need for users to scroll. 
-  Aim for paragraphs that are 75 words or fewer.
-  Sentences should be, on average, 15 words, and 28 words as a maximum.
-  Use shorter and less complicated words where possible.
-  Keep headings 12 words or fewer.

**Break up content:**
-  Use headings.
-  Adopt a flat hierarchy (2-3 tiers).
-  Write short blocks of text (2-4 sentences).
-  Use bullet points.

**Consider the location of content:**
-  Place important content "above the fold" in a webpage.
-  In left-to-right languages, people tend to read in an F shape, so place important content or navigation in the top left.

**Use bold and italics very selectively:**
-  Reserve bolding to call out UI elements and to place emphasis on specific actions. 
-  Don't use quotation marks for emphasis.
-  Avoid using italics for emphasis, where possible.
-  Rather than using bold or italics to emphasise whole phrases, use layout, callouts, headings, and short paragraphs to draw attention to important content or messages.

### Avoid redundancy to maintain the effectiveness of your content

Don't provide unnecessary information. For example, don't give a detailed history the product –– focus on what's new in the particular service and instructions for performing a specific task.

To modify a quote from Antoine de Saint-Exupery, good writing is achieved, not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to remove. 

- Get straight to the point based on what users want and need.
- Eliminate titles that restate the body of an information box in the UI or a paragraph in documentation.
- Remove unnecessary words and content, for example, *"You'll be asked to enter your password~~, which you created in the previous step~~."
- Use as few words as possible to portray meaning. The table, below, outlines some guidance.

|Guideline | Examples |
|---|---|
|Remove empty or unnecessary determiners and modifiers. | "The set up is ~~basically~~ the same"; "The process is ~~actually quite~~ straightforward"; "Selecting this option is ~~really~~ only needed if you're using a Windows machine." |
|Prune every excess or redundant word. | "*Repeat* the steps ~~*again*~~" or "*Revert ~~back~~* to your previous settings." |
|Replace an intensifier or qualifier, along with the adjective it refers to, with a stronger word. | *"very important"* could be replaced with *"crucial"*.|
|Avoid manner adverbs (usually formed from adjectives by adding "-ly") and use precise language, instead. |  "The change takes effect *quickly*", could instead be "The change takes effect within *5 minutes*".
|Replace wordy phrases with single words where possible. | "With the exception of" could be replaced with "Unlike". |

## Writing instructional content

### Bullets and numbering

Use a numbered list to denote the order in which steps are carried out; use bullet points for a general list.

### Emphasis

Use bolding to call out UI elements and to place emphasis on specific actions, such as **Select**, **Delete**, and **Save**. 

### Style

Use the imperative mood for instructions. Sentences with an imperative mood start with an action verb and second person singular, with "you" as its implied subject. Imperative sentences are typically in the active voice. 

### Clickthroughs

Use chevrons (**>**) with spaces around them to separate items in a clickthrough; bold the chevrons. For example: *"To create a shareable link, navigate to the top menu and select **File > Share > Copy Link**"*.

### Terminology

Use the word **click** only to refer to specific mouse actions; in general, avoid talking about mouse actions. Instead, refer to user actions with words like "hover over", "point to", "choose", "select", and "enter". 
 -  Use **select** to instruct the reader to select an item, like text, objects, or cells. 
 -  Use **enter** to instruct the user to type their password or choose a selection from a dialogue box.

### Sentence structure

|Guidance| Example|
|---|---|
|Put conditional clauses before instructions. |*"For more information, see the disclosure document"* (rather than *"See the disclosure document for more information"*). |
|To direct the user to do something, mention the circumstances before you provide the instruction. |*"If you want a PDF of this page, select the **Download** button in the top-right of the screen"* (rather than *"Select the **Download** button in the top-right of the screen for a PDF of this page"*).|
|When writing a series of steps, mention the location, followed by the action. |*"From the drop-down menu, select the type of alert you want to send"* (rather than *"Select the type of alert you want to send from the dropdown menu"*). |
